# DNA Analysis Toolkit
This repository houses a comprehensive suite of tools for DNA analysis, addressing various computational challenges encountered in genetic research and sequencing processes. From efficient suffix tree implementations to advanced contamination detection algorithms, and automated testing functions, this toolkit equips researchers with powerful solutions for exploring and analyzing DNA sequences with precision and efficiency.

SuffixTree Implementation: Utilize the SuffixTree abstract data type (ADT) to efficiently construct suffix trees from tuples of strings, enabling fast retrieval of substrings, node labeling, and depth determination.

Contamination Detection: Detect and quantify contamination in DNA sequences by analyzing known contaminants and their impact on newly isolated DNA strings. The DNAContamination class allows for the verification of contamination degree and identification of contaminants with the highest impact.

Automated Testing: Implement a testing function to evaluate DNA sequences against a dataset of known contaminants, facilitating rapid identification of highly contaminated sequences and enabling timely intervention to prevent erroneous sequencing results.
